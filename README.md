# discord-bot
For the initial steps of making this bot, you first have go to discord developers portal and make a bot there(simply just name it and give the required permissions like sending messages).
Then generate a special token and then finally authorise it! Your bot would be displayed on your server. If you find any difficulty during this process, just check the official documentation on the developers portal.
After that you need to make your bot online on the server so it can send messages when required. For that you can check the bot.py file.
